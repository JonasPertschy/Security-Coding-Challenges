## Security Themed Coding Challenges

These security engineering challenges focus on text parsing and manipulation, basic data structures, and simple logic flows. Give the challenges a go, no need to finish them to completion because all practice helps.

- Cyphers / encryption algorithms 
	- Implement a cypher which converts text to emoji or something.
	- Be able to implement basic cyphers.

- Parse arbitrary logs 
	- Collect logs (of any kind) and write a parser which pulls out specific details (domains, executable names, timestamps etc.)

- Web scrapers 
	- Write a script to scrape information from a website.

- Port scanners 
	- Write a port scanner or detect port scanning.

- Botnets
	- How would you build ssh botnet?

- Password bruteforcer
	- Generate credentials and store successful logins. 

- Scrape metadata from PDFs
	- Write a mini forensics tool to collect identifying information from PDF metadata. 

- Recover deleted items
	- Most software will keep deleted items for ~30 days for recovery. Find out where these are stored. 
	- Write a script to pull these items from local databases. 
 
- Malware signatures
	- A program that looks for malware signatures in binaries and code samples.
	- Look at Yara rules for examples.
